      "Just got these shoes in the mail and was a bit nervous to see if I had ordered the right size given that most of the reviews stated that the shoe runs large. I typically wear an 8.5 or a 9 so I ordered an 8 and it fits perfectly. I certainly wouldn't have wanted them any smaller. I own a pair of Adidas indoor soccer shoes that are a size 9 but I decided to heed the reviewers' advice and drop down a size and I'm glad that I did. I hope this helps you choose the right size!\n",

      "Love them!! I've always loved the classic shell toes! I will say reading the reviews did help when choosing a size. I'm normally a size 7, so I ordered a 6 since all the reviews said \"run large\" and they fit perfectly!!\n",

      "I LOVE these! I'm so happy I read the reviews and sized down. I'm a size 7us and ordered a size 6. They fit great! I'm glad I went a whole size down instead of half a size. They are super cute!\n",

      "These shoes are amazing! I was so anxious that they wouldn't be good but they arrived 6 days earlier than expected. I got them in white and I'm lowkey scared of going outside to get them dirty, so I might even get them in black...\n",
      "The sizing was perfect too, I recommend looking at the sizing chart and of course to go based on your current shoes' size. They feel kind of loose around the heel/ankles, but maybe that's just me being used to high-top shoes where the shoe laces can easily tighten this problem of the shoe slipping a little.\n",
      "Overall though, these shoes look just like the picture if not better irl.\n",

      "Somewhat large maybe because of my narrow feet. i usually wear 7.5 when it comes to sneakers but i orderered 6.5 in this one and its an amazing fit.\n",

      "Read the reviews so knew they ran large. My daughter normally wears a size 9 but ordered a size 8 1/2. They fit perfectly. Super comfortable and she hasn't stopped wearing them since they came. Definite a statement shoe!\n",
